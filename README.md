#### Air Sea Fluxes Data Discovery Dashboard

This is a Plotly Dash application which allows data discovery and plotting
data in the OceanSITES Air-Sea fluxes collection. For a specified time periods,
users can use the interface to
find the answer to the question of which sites have:

- Wind Stress
- Net surface heat flux
- Turbulent heat flux
- Precipitation
- Evaporation minus precipitation

Selecting a station will plot the relevant parameters and provide a link to 
download the plotted data in a variety of formats.
